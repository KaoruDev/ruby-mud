# Ruby-Mud

**TLDR**: Me practing BDD!

**Description**: this my execuse to practice BDD. I used to play M.U.D. ( Multy User Dimensions ) when I was younger.
Basically a text-based MMO...WAY before MMO was a thing and I was using dial-up...yep.

----

### Play!

```
bundle install
ruby mud.rb
```


----

### Run specs
```
bundle exec rspec
```

---

### Add a Character!

too lazy for steps right now... but if you read the code it should be easy enough?

---

### Add a Skill!

Take a look at the [elf's basic attack](https://github.com/KaoruDev/ruby-mud/blob/master/lib/player_characters/elf/actions/basic_attack.rb) to get a good idea.
